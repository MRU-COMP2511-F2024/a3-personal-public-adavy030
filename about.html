            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hi, I'm Anastacia. I am a student at Mount Royal University pursuing a Bachelor of Business Administration with a focus on Marketing and a minor in Computer Science. 
                    Continuously striving for improvement, I am eager to further my knowledge and refine my skills to create meaningful connections and develop my hands-on experience within the evolving industry.
                    I have knowledge in design, event planning, and strategic media planning. 
                </br></br>  
                    I have always had a passion for social media, designing, and planning different projects; whether that be in my schoolwork or the workplace.
                    Additionally, I am proficient in Microsoft Office Suite, Adobe Creative Cloud, Google Analytics, Canva, CRM, Hootsuite, Python, and all social media platforms. Through my experience of marketing, sales, and team-management, I have developed strong communication skills that excel in team environments, and capable of prioritizing tasks,
                    while maintaining an organized system. 
                </br></br> 
                    Furthermore, I have experience with Adobe Creative Suite, which I have used within my courses to redesign brand identities. 
                    Through my experience at Borden Ladner Gervais, I advanced my management and time-management skills by utilizing a CRM to create large contact lists to successfully organize and execute seminars, events, and newsletters by their deadlines. 
                    I also managed and submitted department invoices and monthly credit card reconciliations. 
                    Additionally, my sales experience has developed my communication and teamwork skills, allowing me to form new client relationships and achieve sales goals. 
                </br></br>
                    Apart from my employment, I have recently been elected as president of the Mount Royal Marketing Society, where we coordinate and organize events for student learning opportunities. 
                    I also volunteer with Pride In Business as an administrative assistant. I have experience in various social media platforms, including but not limited to Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok. 
                    My marketing courses have provided me with proficient knowledge and practice in analyzing consumer trends, SEO, and brainstorming ways to create further traffic to websites. 
                    Additionally, I have experience with Adobe Creative Suite, which I have used within my courses to redesign brand identities.
